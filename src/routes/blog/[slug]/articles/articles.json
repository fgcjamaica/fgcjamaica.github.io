{"captain-log-1":"Hello everyone and welcome to our website!!! My name is Stephanie Williams and I am this years FIRST Global Team Captain!\nI currently attend Immaculate Conception High School and am 17 years of age.\n\nI have had a wonderful experience since I became this year's team captain. It has been filled with fun and excitement. The season isnâ€™t over yet and I am looking forward to all the incredible moments that will come with my team mates.\n\nUncle Ben once said `With great power comes great responsibility`, this position has truly challenged me in ways I had not been challenged before. Nevertheless, I am ready to step up to the plate as being the Captain means I am passionate and have the initiative and drive to lead my team mates to victory.\n\nThere have been many ups and some downs as there are in any work space but the overall experience so far as been absolutely amazing. To think we were all strangers at the beginning of the summer but now I would like to say we are all friends.\n\nCaptain Out ðŸ¤ª\n"}

	<h1>Captain Log #1</h1>
	<p>Published: 7 September 2022</p>
	<p>By: Stephanie Williams</p>

	<p>Hello everyone and welcome to our website!!! My name is Stephanie Williams and I am this year's FIRST Global Team Captain!
I currently attend Immaculate Conception High School and am 17 years of age.</p><p>I have had a wonderful experience since I became this year's team captain. It has been filled with fun and excitement. The season isnâ€™t over yet and I am looking forward to all the incredible moments that will come with my teammates.</p><p>Uncle Ben once said <code>With great power comes great responsibility</code>, this position has truly challenged me in ways I had not been challenged before. Nevertheless, I am ready to step up to the plate as being the Captain means I am passionate and have the initiative and drive to lead my teammates to victory.</p><p>There have been many ups and some downs, as there are in any workspace, but the overall experience so far has been absolutely amazing. To think we were all strangers at the beginning of the summer, but now I would like to say we are all friends.</p><p>Captain Out ðŸ¤ª</p></article>
